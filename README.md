<h2> Autonomous Firefighting Robot </h2>

This was the only project idea which was selected from Pakistan in Japan Hackaton. We built a prototype of firefighting robot, initially controlled by a bluetooth connected device. This Robot will work as first respond to sudden fire. We are working on it to make it fully autonomous.
